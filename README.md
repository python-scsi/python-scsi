python-scsi
===========
python-scsi is a SCSI initiator for python.
It contains python classes to create and send SCSI commands to devices
accessible via:

* SGIO: /dev/sg* devices using ioctl(SG_IO)
  Only available for Linux

* iSCSI: iscsi://<server>/<iqn>/<lun>
  Available on all platforms which have libiscsi-python
  See https://github.com/sahlberg/libiscsi-python

These classes also provide interfaces to marshall/unmarshall both CDBs
as well as DATA-IN/OUT buffers.
